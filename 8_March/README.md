## Refined Clock Idea

Related to the theme of the UAE I wanted to make a rotating diorama clock where each diorama represents a different aspect of UAE culture, hobbbies or traditions.

### Pictures 

#### Example of overall structure 
![](pic1.jpg)

The idea will be to have a sort of rotating plate what will be divided into three segemnts each segment being its own diorama that will show different aspects of the UAE.
The dotted line represents the casing/frame that the clock will be inside and the active diorama will protude outside the frame/casing. The rotating mechanism will be a
simple mortor that will simple rorate to a different segment after a certain time interval. To know where to stop the rotation sensors will be attached to the each
segment that when in contact with the Inductive Proximity sensor will tell the rotation to stop. I can only manually add the rotation values if it would be 
too complicated

Next is the side view of the mechanism here the we can see multiple plates that can be used to two more than one diorama at once if needed or to stack different 
dioramas with similar sub-themes.
under each of the plates and under each plate segment will be the housing for mechanical and electronic componets.

#### Diorama example 

Here in this picture you can see an example of how one such segement can be. This segement might show the car culture or racing culture in the use where we can have
several cars attached to cam shafts of different timing and length to give illusion of movement and then for the background there will be a building that will use a
belt mechanism to rotate a bulding around on the segment (mechanism similar to tracks or a pulley) to move the buildoing around and give the feeling of movement.

### Potential Sub-topics for Dioramas

1. Pearl diving and Fishing
2. Embroidery
3. Rally / rancing culture
4. Industrialzation
5. Holidays / special events
