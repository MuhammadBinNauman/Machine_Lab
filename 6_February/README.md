## Cam and Crank Slider 
For this week we made a cam and a crank slider. It was mostly smooth going in terms of assembly and and testing aside from three minor 
falults that were adjusted to fix the contra[tions and get it working properly

### Problems 

The first problem I faced when making the contraption was the slider not rotating properly as it would get stuck at certain angles
The solution I found for this was that the connector rod was too short which resulted in the crank slider moving and rotating at more extreme angles
that exerted forces at the wrong place.

The second problem was with clearance of some of the moving parts as they would sometimes collide with each other due to minor off axis movement.
this was simply fixed by trimming the cardboard down in areas where the collisions were

The last problem was with the motor shaking a bit too much resulting on alot of force on the BBQ skewer that held the Cam toghether. I noticed that the while was slightly misaligned and this caused the unwanted shaking. I simply re-glued the wheel again
